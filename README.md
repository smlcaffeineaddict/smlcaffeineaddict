### Hi I'm Tia ðŸ‘‹
Pronouns: she / her ðŸ˜„ 

Professional background in Graphic & Web Design, and Customer Service wanting to dive head first into the world of IT. Applying a plethora of adaptive skills and extensive customer interaction experience to the environment. Minor experience with IT from personal interaction, knowledge of basic programming, and willingness and ability to learn and adapt quickly to training makes me a keen applicant for the entry-level position in a Virtual Database Support role. 

Experienced Graphic Designer with a demonstrated history of working in the design industry. Skilled in Graphics, Adobe Creative Suite, Branding, and InDesign. Strong arts and design professional with a Diploma focused in Graphic Design and Digital Media, alongside a Diploma of Business from Torrens University focusing on social media and project management.
